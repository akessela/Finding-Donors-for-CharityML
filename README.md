You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
  

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
This project is designed to get acquainted with many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide a method of evaluating each model's performance on a certain type of data. It is important
in machine learning to understand how to select an appropriate machine learning algorithm to use for a given problem.

In this project, I applied supervised learning techniques on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML ( a fictious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause.
Specificically the following items have been covered in the analysis:
* explore the data and learn how the census data is recorded
* apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into workable format.
* Evaluate several supervised learners on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
* census.csv : U.S. census data 
* finding_donors.ipynb : Jputer notebook used for the project
* finding_donors.html: report from the notebook in html format
